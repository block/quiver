Quiver is a library that builds upon [Arrow](https://arrow-kt.io/) to make functional programming in Kotlin even 
more accessible & delightful.

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/app.cash.quiver/lib.svg?label=latest%20release"/>](https://central.sonatype.com/namespace/app.cash.quiver)

There are two published builds.

* `lib` contains types and functions to provide additional functional programming idioms over and above what is available from Arrow.
* `lib-test` contains kotest Matchers and Arbs for writing tests that use types found in `lib`.

## Getting Started

On the [Sontaype page for Quiver](https://central.sonatype.com/namespace/app.cash.quiver), choose the latest version
